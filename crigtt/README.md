# Cancer-Report-Validator (CRV) Project


# Introduction

## Purpose

The Cancer Report Validator (CRV) is an interactive tool for validating the content of electronic submissions of cancer-related medical information prior to a system's communication with a public health central cancer registry. The CRV conforms to the [HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA® Release 2: Reporting to Public Health Cancer Registries from Ambulatory Healthcare Providers, Release 1; DSTU Release 1.1 - US Realm](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=398").

## Background

The [National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR)](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/) is a program run by the
[National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)](http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/) of the
[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](http://www.cdc.gov/). NPCR's mission is to collect data to monitor the burden of cancer, evaluate the
success of programs, and identify additional needs for cancer prevention and control efforts at national, state, and more local levels.

In order to facilitate this goal, central cancer registries have been established to collect data from sources such as hospitals, doctors' offices, and
laboratories on cancer occurrence and type of initial treatment. CRIGTT serves as a means of verifying that the software used by doctors’ offices is capable of
correctly preparing Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) documents for submission. This tool only applies to the format required by Meaningful Use for
physicians and it is not intended to be used for hospital or laboratory reporting.

This initiative has been sponsored by the CDC and is being managed by the [Office of the National Coordinator for Healthcare IT](http://www.healthit.gov/).
